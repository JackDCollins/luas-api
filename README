Endpoint for getting luas (dublin light rail), times and geo-coded data.

Updated to include the newer stops on red line.

This endpoint relies on http://www.luas.ie and may break at any time, I will try my best to keep it updated.

Example #1: get times of next luas in both directions.

ap.php?action=gettimes&station=leopardstown-valley

Result:

{"inbound":[{"dest":"St. Stephen's Green","time":"DUE"},{"dest":"St. Stephen's Green","time":"17"}],"outbound":[{"dest":"Bride's Glen","time":"4"}]}


Example #2: Get the co-ordinates of a stop.

ap.php?action=getcoords&station=the-four-courts

Result:

[53.346824,-6.27291]
